so will need three models

and three pufs 

the actual input mapping for each of them will prolly be different 

for results need all the graphs

and maybe explain what goes into the input mapping for each one

which basically determines how secure the PUFS

start with arbiter puf for LR, then perceptron, and then nerual network 

then move to next one bsacially just chaning the input mapping


-------------------------------------------------------


Okay so 

Lets get working graphs and metrics for each model first 

LR
perceptron
NN

Once that works get them for the none and arbiter so we have comparisons

# also make file system after the graphs work so the folders are organized i guess

Next we haae two pufs left
the main things to actually change is jsut the input mapping if eveyrhting else was done correctly


Start with Interpose I guess

- im guessing it will be bad for most of the models 

Then somehting else
------------------------------
Extra not really extra add the README 
    - for readme if u are running make sure to have folders premade cuz i didn't put check for it 
also push this on github
MAYBE SET THE LIMITS OF THE AXES 
right now we save th models but don't do anything with them maybe if we want to have like a tester script i guess
also manually changing the numbers for different models rn

maybe add noise to training pufs??

lightweight secure puf
or feed forward xor
maybe no interpose?
okay so arbiter, xor, lightweight, then mention that there are more and harder 

okay cool do tests for xor, then try to do tests for lightweight
then change the num crps for the bad ones, then retrain
then change the num of chains, then retrain 
try adding noise for one 
and then get all graphs and make presentation
